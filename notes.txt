Concept
Building a Network Intrusion Detection System
Flags Network activities as Attack and Normal of collected summarised connection data(binary classification problem)
Supervised Classification 
Recall matters more than accuracy
data pre-processing: Basically encoding categorical features, scaling numerical values, and converting labels into a binary format.Scaling helps for consistency and avoiding biases for the model.
